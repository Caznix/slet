# slet - named this way for no particular reason

## gameplay

Slet is a sendbox towerdefence full of mechanical centepedes. Player has can controle a centepide, initially composed of start and the end and by collecring points, he can gain various segments which have special purposes and gimmics. Each segment can be dropped on the ground in which case it gets deployed, gains boost and becomes automatic. Yes this is kind-of a towerd defence strategy where you manage segments and fend agains enemies gradually spawinig around your core segments. the main challinge is based on the fact that when you carry a core as a segment, you become relly slow so enemies should catch up, this can motivate player to place and protect the core instead of infinitely running away and accumulating "followers". 

This game is more of a toy and for now level (only one) is infinite with continuous increase of difficulty. To increase depth, player will be able to build new cores which split the enemy attention while less then dobling the enemy spawn rate, which balances risk/benefit of building more cores (loosing a core puts you in disadvantage but more cores you have, the bigger defense surface you can maintain, distributing the pressure).

Your segments can be destroyed, but they can aslo passively heal when not in combat...
